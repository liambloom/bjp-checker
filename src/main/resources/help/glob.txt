Glob is one or more paths with the following formatting:
  /        A slash is used as a directory separator, regardless of OS. A
              path with a leading slash is relative to the root directory,
              all other paths are relative to the current location
  ?        A wildcard representing a single character other than '/'
  *        A wildcard representing one or more characters other than '/'
  **       A wildcard representing zero or more path segments (a path segment
              is a piece of a path delimited by a '/'
  \        Escapes a '/', '?', '*', or '\'
  .        The current directory
  ..       The parent directory

 Paths that begin with "tests", if not surrounded by single or
    double quotes, will validate tests instead of running them.
 Directory beginning with '/' are relative to the root.
