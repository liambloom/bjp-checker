Glob is one or more paths with the following formatting:
  Path segments are pieces of a path separated by '/', or '.'
  /        A slash is used as a directory separator, regardless of OS. A
              path with a leading slash is relative to the root directory,
              all other paths are relative to the current location
  ?        A wildcard representing a single character other than '/' or '.'
  *        A wildcard representing one or more characters other than '/' or '.'
  **       A wildcard representing zero or more path segments
  " or '   A path that contains whitespace or starts with "tests" should be
               surrounded by single or double quotes
  \        Escapes a '/', '?', '*', '"', ''', or '\'

 Note: paths that begin with "tests" will, if not surrounded by single or
    double quotes, will validate tests instead of running them.
